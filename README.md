Yo! **Wutup** is a social event management service that allows users to create and promote events,
invite friends to events, and register for events.  Events can be searched by category, geography, 
sponsor, or date range.  The service connects to social networking sites like facebook and twitter
for promotion and registration, and exposes a RESTful API so developers can generate any number 
of clients (web, mobile web, iOS, Android, an so on).

The project was originally developed by the LMU CMSI 401 Software Engineering Laboratory class during
the 2012 fall semester. This fork contains enhancements from continued development by Richard Brous.
